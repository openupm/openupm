  Google Analytics helps you understand and engage your players by revealing
  what actions they're taking inside your game, where they spend the most time,
  and why they churn. From acquisition to app usage, Google Analytics will give
  you insights to make better decisions about your game. You can even combine
  your analytics data with Google Ads to make sure you're running campaigns that
  deliver you high-quality players.
