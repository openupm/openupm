  Store and sync data in near-realtime.


  Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and
  sync JSON data in near-realtime. It's optimized for very rapid syncing of
  small amounts of data.


  When your players go offline, the Realtime Database SDKs use local cache on
  the device to serve and store changes. When the device comes online, the local
  data is automatically synchronized so people can keep playing your game from
  where they left off.
