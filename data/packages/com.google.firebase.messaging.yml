  Send targeted messages and notifications.


  Cloud Messaging gives you a reliable and battery-efficient way to send
  messages and notifications across platforms. You can target your messages to
  certain segments of players and customize them to suit your game's brand. You
  can also gauge their effectiveness with statistics like click rate, open rate,
  and the downstream effect on conversions.
