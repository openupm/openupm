displayName: Multipeer Connectivity Transport for Netcode for GameObjects
description: >-
  This package implemented the transport layer of Netcode for GameObjects with
  Apple Multipeer Connectivity, which can enable peer-to-peer communication
  between nearby devices.


  By using Multipeer Connectivity, nearby devices can connect to each other when
  there is no WiFi or cellular network. Multipeer Connectivity is the technology
  behind AirDrop, which means it can transfer large file between devices very
  fast.
