  Run your mobile backend code without managing servers.


  With Cloud Functions, you can write and deploy code to our servers that
  automatically responds (i.e. executes) to events in your game.


  This way, your game logic is fully insulated from the client so you can be
  sure its functions are private and can't be reverse engineered. Cloud
  Functions also automatically scales up computing resources to match the usage
  patterns of your game.
