description: >-
  The Graph Toolkit package provides a comprehensive set of APIs that developers
  can use to create graph editing tools. This framework allows you to create
  tailored, node-based workflows. It handles the foundational basics so you can
  spend less time on setup and more time building graph solutions.


  By default any graph tools built with this package conform to Unity UI and UX
  standards, ensuring consistency and quality. However, there is also lots of
  room for customization to fit the needs of unique projects.
