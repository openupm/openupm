  Deep link potential players to the right place inside your game.


  Dynamic Links are smart URLs that allow you to send existing and potential
  players to any location within your game. They survive the game install
  process, so even new players see the content they're looking for when they
  open the game for the first time. Dynamic Links are free forever, for any
  scale.
