  Prioritize and fix stability issues faster.


  Firebase Crashlytics helps you track, prioritize, and fix stability issues
  that erode game quality, in realtime. Spend less time triaging and
  troubleshooting crashes and more time building game content and features that
  delight players.


  Crashlytics also sends realtime alerts for new issues, regressed issues, and
  burgeoning issues that might require immediate attention to ensure you never
  miss a critical crash no matter where you are.
