  CsoundUnity is a fully integrated audio middleware. It extends Unity's audio
  API by creating Csound-based AudioSource objects that can interact and exist
  alongside regular AudioSource objects. 

  With CsoundUnity, games developers have at their fingertips one of the most
  powerful synthesis systems in existence.

  This interface would not have been possible without Richard Henninger's .NET
  interface to the Csound API.
